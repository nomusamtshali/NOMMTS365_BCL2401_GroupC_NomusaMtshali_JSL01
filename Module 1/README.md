# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

# Project Overview

- I was given a task to write a function that takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, starting with "pet\_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax, I must be able to make it return "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, return "Invalid Syntax". I had to modify the script.js file I was given to correct the syntax errors and save the file. I used JavaScript.

# Elements Included

- JavaScript modification that validates pet adoption details syntax
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code file.

## Reflections

# Areas of Mastery

- Unfortunately, in this project, there weren't any areas of mastery that stood out for me. I felt overwhelmed by the content and I wasn't able to master any areas

# Challenges Faced

- I faced the challenge of finding the correct solution to code that would validate the pet adoption syntax as per the task/project instructions. This presented issues which I had to solve by doing more research and asking for assistance from my colleagues.

# Areas for Improvement

- Understanding syntax clearly and using the "IF" and "ELSE" keywords to build conditional statements.

### Overall Learning Experience

- The project was a bit challenging when I took a look at it, but as I read through my LMS content, I got an idea of what to do. I saw that understanding JavaScript fundamentals is crucial as it forms the building blocks for more advanced concepts. I also need to grasp the concept of validation and why it's important in web development. I found regular expressions really interesting. Overall, this project opened up my mind a bit.
